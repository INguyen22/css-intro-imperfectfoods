    <p>Sign up for free by choosing a plan and then taking our quiz so that we can learn your dietary preferences and provide recommendations based on your answers.</p>
    <p>You’ll receive a delivery date based upon your zip code. You’ll see when you can expect a delivery, e.g. “Thursday afternoon/evening.”</p>
    <p>You’ll be given a window to shop — a timeframe to log into your account and customize your order. Think of it like your weekly trip to the store, but way more convenient.</p>
    <p>While your shopping window is open, you’ll be able to add groceries to your cart and take things out as often as you like. Choose from around 60 produce items and around 200 grocery staples.</p>
